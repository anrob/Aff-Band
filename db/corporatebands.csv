What do Kaleidescope clients have to say about Kaleidescope?

The band was fabulous. They are consistently wonderful to work with and are professional and fun. Beyond that, they make the clients (parents of the bride as well as the bride and groom themselves) feel that they are excited and delighted to be performing at their event and there's no amount of training, begging, cajoling or explaining that can make people convey that to a client if they don't 'get' it. This event ran until 12:45 which is always a little dicey in Washington. At 12:45 last night, there were a solid 75-90 people still on the dance floor and they would happily have danced another ½ hour if the band had played longer. We left the guests wanting more. The family was thrilled and pronounced it a perfect night. I couldn't have been happier.

I hope you'll share my comments with everyone in the band. I love working with the group and wish I could do that every weekend.

Please make sure they know how much fun I had working with them.

Numerous repeat clients have declared time and again that choosing this band guarantees that their event will be an overwhelming success. Much credit goes to three very talented and powerful front line singers, a killer horn section, plus a bandleader who listens to the client, plans the play list carefully, and never loses touch with the pulse of the party.
